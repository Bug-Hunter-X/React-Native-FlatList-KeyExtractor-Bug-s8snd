This React Native bug occurs when using the FlatList component with a large dataset and involves the keyExtractor prop.  If the keyExtractor function doesn't return unique keys for each item, or if it returns keys that change unexpectedly, the FlatList component may exhibit erratic behavior like incorrect item rendering, flickering, or crashes. This is because FlatList uses the keys to efficiently track and update items, and non-unique or inconsistent keys lead to issues in its internal mechanisms.
